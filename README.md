This is a GPL licensed Usenet reader I wrote around 2010 for Android. I stopped
using Usenet so I didn't develop it any further. 

Adrian Gruntkowski ("zoldar" on the Android Market) offered to maintain and
develop it further and I transferred the project to him on the Market, but he
hasn't released a single version, so if somebody is interested to fork and
continue developing this you have my blessing.
